# AsKan

This is yet another (abandoned) Java steelyard application that I developed for a former client of mine.

Features:
- Reading truck weight from the serial port
- SQL server based data queue
- SAP integration
- Ability to work offline (without SAP connection)
- Multiple business scenarios involving SD &MM

For the record; due to project management issues, the project never went live.
